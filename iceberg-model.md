# Why Microsoft 365 adoption projects fail

## intro about the challenge: 

* adoption is hard because people don't understand WHY they need to change their working behavior
* to simply explain it would be to increase productivity, is not enough, it doesn't connect nor does it reflect their beliefs
* without a shared vision/common understanding, we will only scratch the surface of what M 365 could do in an organization

The necessity of understanding the real challenge isn't acutally that new: In the 90's the term VUCA was invented by the US military to describe our modern world and the challenges any organization (not only the military) was facing. This acronym describes a world, in which change becomes a new constant, so planability and consistency are not the factors to describe current markets and environments for organizations.

**Volatility**
The world is changing faster than ever before BUT the world will never change as slowly as it is right now. New challenges, competitors and different unpredictable factors are something we have to deal with. That means, that long term planning and the reliability of this planning won't be sufficient for modern organizations.

**Uncertainty**
Predictability and calculability of events are rapidly decreasing, forecasts and experiences from the past as a basis for shaping the future are losing their validity and relevance. Just look at how quickly and comprehensively Covid19 has changed the way we are working right now. Do we have to say more?

**Complexity**
Living in a complex and connected world with various connections that are difficult to keep track of makes it difficult to clearly define cause and effect. The world is not just complicated, it's complex.

**Ambiguity**
The aspects described above make it clear that decisions today are no longer straightforward. 'One size fits all' is rarely a suitable model anymore. More and more often, it is not a question of WHAT, but of HOW, and WHY. This leads to the fact that the demands on organizations today are paradoxical, sometimes even contradictory.

You might think 'So what? The world is changing and markets are getting more complex, so where is the news?', right? Okay, here's the catch:
We've build organizations around structures and processes that were invented to deal with different requirements. The way we build up and think of organizations are still based on the idea, that markets are predictable, change can be planned and our world works in a consistent way.

So ultimately, we need a new way of thinking about organizations and the way we work. We need new guidelines and principles, that fit the challenges we're facing right now, that fit this new world.

In other word, this new world comes with a need to transform: 

**Profit -> Purpose**
Maximising profit was the main driver for successful businesses for a long time. Yet within a connected world full of information that isn't the only constant that ensures success nowadays. Customers often have enough information to compare different organizations and are able to choose who they're engaging with. That appears to customers and employees to the same extend. Nowadays there are many factors that need to be taken into account for a successful business: work ethics, social responsibility, the ecological factor, and so on. Those things often come, when an organization has a clear purpose, a WHY. Organisations that know why there are doing something, rather than relying on the how have a far better standing in the markets than others. And you know what the trick is? With purpose come profit, but it doesn't work the other way around. Customers and partners have a pretty good idea who they want to deal with and that's what differs a successful organization from a unsuccessful.

**Hierarchies -> Networks**
In a world where we have a compliacted, yet clear task with multiple people to work on that task, you need someone who has a clear understanding of what there is to do. Someone to keep all the strings together and knows where to go. With that comes a clarity about hierarchy, line of command and power. Within a world that is changing fast and context isn't to be overseen by one (or a couple) person, you we into the problem, that there isn't THE right way, that one person likely can't understand all interdependencies. This person has to rely on others to tackle the current task. Yet a clear line of command and a strict hierarchy are opposed to this. Self-organized teams, collaboration between internal and external staff over many borders require a different understanding of leadership and collaboration. Rather than a clear line of command, networks work much better these days to connect different people and create exchanges that meet the requirements.

**Controlling -> Empowering**
Keep the *Hierachy - Network* idea in the back of your mind and spin the thought further: If you can connect with different people, regardless their physical location, neither their standing within a hierarchy, you need them to be able to do something. Within strict organization with constricting processes built in communications and IT departments, people have no chance to make an impact. When you are at the wrong position in the hierarchy, you'll never contribute. But what if the earthshaking idea is in the head of somebody who can't contribute? In this modern, ever changing world the person at the top is not necessarily the one with the best idea. Often it's quite the opposite: How often do people on the front line, interacting with customers and challenges, know exactly how to solve those needs?

**Planning -> Experimentation**
For ages planability and predictability of strategies were a winning factor of organizations and the one, hero-like, manager who could forsee what was going to happen was at the top of the hierarchy. But if we know, that the environment of organizations is characterized by the VUCA components, this long-term planability isn't sufficient. The opposite of this business model is one that is characterized by short iterations. A short term experiment that might seal the deal, yet isn't a complete catastrophe if it's not. 
Do you know where you know this principle from? That's right, from every agile approach ever. Short sprints are way more efficient than the old waterfall approach. Yet the structures we find in modern organizations don't allow such an approach, because they still solidify an old mindset.

**Privacy  -> Transparency**
'Intellectual property is good and if you have or know something, keep it for yourself so you can climb up that hierarchy ladder. And of course you will build up a competitive advantage.' These thoughts don't make sense anymore and don't fit a modern and agile organizations: It is impossible to know which information might become useful in the future and which expert we will need to pass an upcoming challenge. Therefore we need to be open-minded, think in networks and empower people to participate in the meaning of our purpose. 

Digitalization needs to be the accelerator on that, but can never be the main driver. We need a new approach to think about work in general.

Microsoft 365 can be one step to achieve transformation, but is not a goal by itself. Just rolling out Microsoft 365 (or a subset of its tools and services) won't solve our Vuca problems. We need to see the bigger picture to figure out with which part of it Microsoft 365 can help, because we won't solve any problem with assigning licenses to users. 


## approach to solve the issue:

Before we can change how we do an M 365 project to solve our oldworld problems it, we first need to understand old and desired new ways of working and get the bigger picture of the situation we are facing. A good tool to facilitate deeper thinking is the iceberg model. 

### whats is the iceberg model

![iceberg model of visible events and unvisble patterns, systems and mental models](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/iceberg.jpg "The iceberg model - a tool to get the bigger picture")

As we know, that an iceberg shows only its tip above the water and that most of it is hidden underneath it, it works as a good metaphor for things that are not visible obviously to us. The iceberg model introduces us to 4 different stages, which we will uncover now: 


* Events:

Very visbibly, we will find events. An event is the answer to the question *What is happening right now?*
On this level, people only *react* on what just happened and then stop to think about it. For example: "I caught a cold."

* Patterns:

Already underneath the surface, we will find patterns: *What has been happening over time? What are the trends?* 
On this level, people think about what led to the visible event and try to connect the dots, for example: "I caught a cold more often in the past when I slept less".
 
* Structures:

Digging one level deeper, we will see which system supports and influences these patterns: *What's influencing these patterns?
Where are the connections between patterns?* 
On this level, people think about what influences these patterns and try to understand the *Why*, for example: "Working crazy hours, worrying about problems at work and eating late night affected my quality of sleep". 

* Mental models:

Finally, we will investigate, *what values, beliefs or assumptions shape the system and keep it in place?* People now dig into which thinking generated the structures that are in place, for example: "Our belief of "work is the most important thing, even more important than health and the more I do the more valuable I am" led to my behavior (which seemed to be normal, because everyone did that) which resulted in physical manifestation of unhealthy work ethics that showed as catching colds easily"

Let's have a look on how this works in the "old world" 

short intro old world
not productive, incompliant working behavior... 

### iceberg of the old world

* level 1: events - what just happened: 

People can't focus, experience both a lack of efficiency AND effectiveness, waste their times with tasks they shouldn't do at all and are rather busy than productive.

* level 2: patterns - what was happening over time? 

People abuse tools, work around disfunctional processes, communication patterns and organizational structures. They are not familiar with the art of collaboration, feel to be under pressure to be always available and react on everythintg instantaneously. High frequency of task-switching while working rather next to each other than together is challenging and exhausting. 

* level 3: structure- what is influencing these patterns? 

Typical organizations look like a pyramide, with a  few decision-makers at the top (leadership) and the rest of the workforce at the bottom, which is a result from the approach to design companies like military institutions with a defined chain of command and with compartmentalized structures. This led to departments, which don't communicate well and are now rather information silos. The given structure leads to processes, that make sure that this structure stays as it is - which conflicts directly with the need to convert from privacy to transparency, from planning to experimentation and from controlling to empowering. But segmentation of organization is not only an issue across departments (horizontically), but also in in hierarchy (vertically), which leads us to another iceberg, that is responsible for a lack of understanding of problems of workforce by leadership: 

![iceberg of ignorance](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/icebergignorance.jpg)

[source](https://corporate-rebels.com/iceberg-of-ignorance/)

Leadership, who doesn't understand issues and a workforce, that can not regularly connect to their leadership team lead to processes which do not reflect the work that needs to be done, structures that cement the status quo and decisions about tools and working methods that serve old principles privacy, planning and controlling. 
 
* level 4

Let's have a look which collective believes in our culture (which is then only reflected in corporate cultures and way to often reduced to "individual mindset": What do we people believe in, that they design organizations like this? Of course, redesigning takes a huge amount of energy (and money) and surely it is easier to keep the status quo than to change. But why is this status quo, this broken system tsill om place? Because we (or at least enough of us in key posistions) believe in "knowledge is power" instead of "Sharing is Caring". The "command and control" approach looks as if it also provides security and predictibility, and although we already know better, we stick to this *ego system* instead of an *eco system*. 

What can we now do about it? Make people aware of the broken system that doesn't meet our needs anymore and that forces people into workarounds, unhealthy work ethics and poor connection to their organization. Stop trying to fix users when we need to fix this system. 

### iceberg of the desired new world


You see what happens here, right? When we approach a modern workstyle mindset as we usually do, we barely go to the root of the problem at all. We're barely scratching the surface of it. And that is all fair and square but we also know that when we're fixing the symptons of the problem, our solutions won't sustain. 
Because in the end, we are confusing cause and effect. If we only focus on the cause and just try to fix the symptoms, we barely fix the underlying issue at all. We need to work on the cause, to end up with a different effect in the end. What we really want to achieve in the first place, is a sustainable change of habits towards a better work environment and a healthy mindset. If we want to change people's behavior, which we see in level 1, we will need to change our core beliefs and mental models of level 4. 

To give you a little guidance, here is a quick walkthrough of the iceberg model of the desired new world:


Luise: 
* level 4
* level 3
* level 2
* level 1


### what would we need to change? 


Luise & Michael
What needs to happen? What needs to be done/achieved on level 4 so that visible behavior in level 1 is desired new behavior?

* collective consciousness, not individual responsibility
* corporate culture, if we not only commit to our values but also live and breath and work by them
* walk the talk
