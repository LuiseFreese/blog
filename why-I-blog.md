# Why I blog and how

I run this blog since a few years and sometimes people outside of my filter bubble ask me why I do this, as noone pays me for that and I don't have any ads on my website. Instead of explaining this over and over again, I decided to write a meta blog post on why I blog. If you come across my website for the very time today: I mostly blog about Microsoft 365 and Power Platform, sometimes I throw in some more personal posts as well. 

## Why do I blog

### Sharing Is Caring

Seems we already covered the first reason for me to blog: If I know something that could potentially be valuable for others, it will be smart for me to write it down and make it accessible everyone. Some people then wonder, that if I share my professional knowledge for free, that this would weaken my position, that there will be less demand to hire me or others as consultants or developers. But I think that the opposite is true: By showing my knowledge and even sharing my learning journey in public, potential customers see what I am capable of and they don't need to guess if I have the right skillset nor if we have the right fit on a more personal level. Being open and sharing my knowledge has always been a big driver in my carreer, running this blog is part of it!

### Solidifying my knowledge

If we need to explain something you know to someone else, we will likely try to find examples, analogies and metaphors that our audience will find relatable, which will increase their understanding. Same happens when we blog about a solution or write a how-to guide or elaborate on thoughts regarding a product or a certain behaviour. We need to slow down our thinking and try to see our topic with different eyes. Changing the perspective will enable us to see the whole picture and will complement what we already know. It will allow us to flip sides and perceive our knowledge from a fresh view. And it will force us to get familiar not only with the 'hows', but also with the 'whys' of  best practices or different approaches as we will need to explain everything in detail. This applies even more, when we want to write bias- and assumtion-free, beginner-friendly content.

### Exploring new areas

Sometimes, we do not only write about what we already know, but also about topics we want or need to explore. And then the fact, that we really need to understand the nitty gritty details lead to discovering more and more levels- and very often we will be surprised that the post actually took more time tob write, covers this topic in more depth and that we learned so much by writing it. Of course, if we happily jump into a new rabbit hole, we can't know how deep this is and how much time and effort it will take us to understand it. Perhaps we will notice half-way, that our previous assumptions, where this post will lead to, were partially or completely wrong, or we will learn, how our freshly gained knowledge connects to and relates with the things we already know. This is very rewarding for me, personally: not only learning fact, but actually being able to connect the dots and make sense of subjects, that I didn't (fully) understand before. As the world (and tech) gets more complex, it's so important to understand impacts of for example new features, changes in licensing, product launches etc.

### Extending comfort zone

But there is another aspect of writing what we know or what we want to explore. It is about being open our learning journing and finding joy in being a #LearnItAll. I don't think, that stepping outside of our comfort zones (and then returning to it) is something we should look for. I rather aim to *extend* my comfort zone so that once I managed to do the thing outside of my comfort zone, my comfort zone (and me within) grow.

### Reuseability /Repurposeability

Once I wrote a blog post, I can repurpose the gained/solidified knowledge eaily: I can give sessions, workshops, talks about it, participate with my perspective in panel discussions or TweetJams or interviews and do not need to limit myself to the fact that this is a one-time-publishing event. Reusing my content makes me aware about how much I already know and what is still not adressed to everyone. As we know, that new people start every day, and we overestimate a lot what people know. Therefore it's a good idea to reuse what we already published, because it will not only expose us to new audiences, but also help them to find their way into this community and to pay it forward as well.
