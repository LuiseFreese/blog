# How to build an FAQ bot for Microsoft Teams with Power Virtual Agents in minutes

In this blog I want to show you, how you can build, test and publish an FAQ bot for Microsoft Teams within minutes. We will use the Power Virtual Agents for Teams, which means, that you will not need any additional license to your Microsoft 365 license, for reference see also [Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/requirements-licensing-subscriptions#power-virtual-agents-for-microsoft-teams-plan). 

## What is Power Virtual Agents?

Power Virtual Agents belongs like Power Apps, [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) and Power Bi to the Power Platform (wow, that was a powerFULL sentence ðŸ˜‡). You can create chatbots, which can interact with users in apps and websites, trigger workflows and more, without the need of writing code. You can choose if you want to use it in the [Power Virtual Agents standalone web app](https://powerva.microsoft.com) or as [app within Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/PVAForTeams).

## Let's build a bot

I will guide you how to create an FAQ bot. To feed our bot we will need some FAQ so that our can bot can learn them. I will use [FAQ regarding licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq) ðŸ¤“, but you can choose any FAQ from a website or PDF or even Word file that you like.
