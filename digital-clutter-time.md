# digital clutter and how we use our time

Do you sometimes have that feeling of being busy and under pressure for the whole day (or even the whole week) and still couldn't check off all tasks from your list? Do you have the presentiment, that although we all so focus on productivity, efficiency and getting the most out of everything we still scratch the surface and still get in our own way with how we structure our workdays? Well, welcome to the club, you are not alone.

## focus time & collaboration

As we know, that collaboration is very important, that we are better together in achieving goals and that teamwork is our reality, it seems as if we forget, that there are not only teamwork-oriented periods but that we also the need focus time, to prepare, process, and evaluate content as well as leverage ideas. How often are our days full of back-to-back meetings, how often do meetings overlap? How often do we feel that we do not even have time enough to eat, go to the restroom, get a fresh coffee? Not to mention actually taking a break or get some fresh air? I know, we are all very busy, our days are all tighly timed, even lunchtime needs to be productive.

But why do we attend all these meetings without taking the time to capture and condense the insights, process information, and reevaluate decisions? How intense is our commitment towards the goals of these meetings if they only consume our time but we don't make time to reflect on them? How do we decide if we should be part of a meeting? Becaue we've been invited to it? Because a certain process requires the attendance of the role that I incorporate? Because we noticed  a lack of information flow and want to talk with a group of people synchronously? I like to apply the 'rule of two feet' from the barcamp approach: If I can't learn nor contribute in a meaningful way, I will leave (or not even accept the invite) respectfully - and noone feels upset. Why? Because my presence is not required in all meetings and a good summary sometimes is more valueable than trying to squeeze in another meeting. 

These days, it sometimes feels as I was talking 8 hours straight into my webcam, which is energy draining not only because I miss meeting people in reality, but also because quickly switching contexts and needing to then fully focus on the next bunch people is exhausting. No time to actually take a moment and work through what happened in a meeting makes a lot of meetings pointless. Good meetings add value to our work and we are able to add value to other's work. To determine, if at least one of these take place, we should not accept any invite by default. 

### Don't accept meetings by default

Ask yourself: 

* What's the meeting’s purpose?
* What value can you can add?
* What is the most critical information you want to deliver, and what more do you want to contribute?
* Do you have a critical role to play? 
* What exactly do you hope to learn from the call?
* Which specific questions do you have? 

Once you can answer these questions, in best case even jot down your answers, you can more easily make a better decision weather to attend or to decline and still be prepared to continue collaboration. Taking time to clarify intent is a step that we should consider to do before taking action. 

### If you zone out, leave

Heard your colleagues saying: "I will mute myself because I need to work on something aside, but I still listen with one ear"? Please ask them to leave in these cases. MUltitasking is an illusion and if some participants can#t fully commit to contribute it's rather a waste of time than adding value in a meaningful way.
