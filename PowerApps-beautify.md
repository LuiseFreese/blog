# 3 Tipps to beautify your Power Apps

## Fluent UI icons

Power Apps offers you a broad variety of icons - and recently, there some were nice additions announced and rolled out. But if we want to create even more visually appealing apps, it makes sense to extend our pretty little icon library. Microsoft provides us with [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/).

> Fluent UI is a collection of UX frameworks for creating beautiful, cross-platform apps that share code, design, and interaction behavior

One part of Fluent UI is the iconography

### How to get Fluent UI icons

You can browse through the icons in the [Fluent UI icons tool](https://uifabricicons.azurewebsites.net/), but there is right-click, download option. As a developer, you can import Fluent UI iconography (and more) into your applications, for Power Apps there a different ways how to use them:

#### Use a community driven tool to import icons to Power Apps 

there are several tools available to get Fluent UI icons into Power Apps, find two of them here: 

* [Office Ui Fabric Icon Generator](https://github.com/e-gallis/PowerApps/tree/master/Components/OfficeUIFabricIconGenerator)
* [2000 free Power Apps icons](https://matthewdevaney.com/2000-free-power-apps-icons/)

However, if you only want to use a few specific icons for an app or would like to try them out, you can head over to the [Fluent UI repository on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/blob/master/icons.md) and rightclick-download the icons. After that, you upload them to your Power App and can use them like any other image. Super cool: You get all icons as .svg files, which have 3 big advantages: 

* .svg are transparent, which means you have no additional work to remove any background
* .svg are loss less scalable, which means that you blow them up as you like it ðŸ’¥
* .svg have are usually smaller than .jpg files of same quality - this will have a nice effect on the performance of your app

## Pop Ups

Screens in Power Apps are perfect to display information that should always be shown. But what if we only want to occasionally show some additional content? Pop up to the rescue!

To create a pop up effect, create: 

![](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/beautify/controls.png)

* a rectangle, that overlays the content that our user now should not focus on - good idea to have it filled grey and semi-transparent
* a rectange, smaller than the GreyOutRectangle, filled in in brighter backgroundcolor
* a textlabel which shows the information
* a cancel icon

Group these controls, its easier to work with them then. 

* Now create a textlabel (or a button, or an image... something that our user shall click on to see the pop up).
* Set the .onSelect property of this label to `UpdateContext({isShowPopUp:true})`
* Set the .onSelect propert of the cancel icon to `UpdateContext({isShowPopUp:false})`
* Set the .visible property of the whole PopUp Group tp `isShowPopUp`

this way, we set the **isShowPopUp** variable to `true`, if user clicks the label, which will make the PopUp visble. As soon as the user clicks the cancel icon, the **isShowPopUp** variable is set to `false`, which means that the group will not be shown anymore!

## Create an expand- and collapse able menu

As we need to carefully deal with all screen estate, it is a cool idea, to have an menue, that can expand and collapse. To create this, we need 

* a collection which holds the screens that we want our users allow to navigate to
* a gallery, which displays the items of our collection
* a Hamburger Menu icon, which sets a variable to control the width of the gallery

1. collecion

To have icons (which shall show while the menu is collapsed) and text (that shall show up right next to our icons when the menu is expanded) we will first upload a few svgs (see above) and then refer to them in our collection: 

`ClearCollect(
        NavigationMenu,
        {
            Row: 1,
            Title: "About",
            Image: ic_fluent_lightbulb_24_regular
        },
        {
            Row: 2,
            Title: "Flights",
            Image: ic_fluent_airplane_take_off_24_regular
        },
        {
            Row: 3,
            Title: "Hotels",
            Image: ic_fluent_bed_24_regular
        },
        {
            Row: 4,
            Title: "People",
            Image: ic_fluent_people_32_regular
        }
        )
);`
\

2. Gallery

We create a gallery, and set the .items property to our collection
We set the .width property to `If(!IsExpand, 200, 50)`  or similar - first value is the expanded width, second is the non-expanded (collapsed) width. 

As we want to pretty things up a little bit, 

* add a small rectangle to your gallery
* add a rectangle (width = 1) to the right of your gallery  

3. Hamburger menue
we add a hamburger menu icon and set its .onSelect property to `Set(IsExpand, !IsExpand)`

4. adjust all other controls on the screens

Now work on the .X property of all lavels, buttons, images etc. Set it to 

`If(!IsExpand, <original value>,<originalvalue>-150)`

Our result should look something like this:
