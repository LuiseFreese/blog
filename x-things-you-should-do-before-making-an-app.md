# 10 things you should think about before you go to make.powerapps.com

With Power Apps, we can rapidly build custom business applications that connect to our business data in a low code manner. This means, that not only professional developers can build applications, but that a lot more people will be able to make apps that fit their use specific use cases. 

But as development is not only writing code, there are certainly some things we should do before we actually hit [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com). This post will list 10 things, that we should think about before we start building our app. 

## which problem does the app solve? 

This sounds obvious, that one would first do a proper analysis of value proposition and if the app they have in mind is actually a must-have solution to a specific business case or if its more or less 'yet another thing to use', although there are working alternatives in place. 

### understand your market 

Take some time segment your market and understand who (even if you build for your colleagues) needs your app. There will be roles, that will rely on your app, so it will become mission critical to them. Others will have already found applications that do similar things or the app doesn't solve a problem that is relevant to them. You can try to specifically look at underserved groups, such as blue collar workers and see if you can address their needs. Becoming obsessed with solving specific needs without assumptions is key here. This means, that you will need to validate the need that you have in mind. Even if you consider yourself a business user/power user /citizen developer, doesn't necessarily mean that you are your user. 

### psychological strain vs. energy of change

We've heard it probably before: To make users love an app, you will need to not only solve their pains or adress their needs, but also make it not too hard for them to change their behavior. If the energy they will need to change their behavior is higher than the psychological strain they face right now, they will not adapt your app, it's unfortunately as simple as that. 

## calculate value

Now you have a fair idea of who will use your app for which use cases and also know what users are doing now: 

* abuse other tools
* work on paper
* purchase 3rd party tools
* use unapproved shadow IT tools

and to which results this leads

* be busy with tasks that don't add value
* lose information
* cause additional costs
* severe risks in terms of data security, governance, compliance etc. 

tl;dr: more costs, less value. 

But take the effort to actually calculate the higher costs in terms ofg money and time and make an estimation for 12 or 24 months.


* mock up your app
* decribe value / calculate costs / licensing

* data model
* plan who will maintain and support the app
* what about new features
* what is your mvp?
* which dependencies do you have? 
* who are your users? 
* will it scale?
* how are you going to document your app?
