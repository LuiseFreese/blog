# How to create a Content plan for your Social Media activities and automate all the boring work

I love SharePoint and I am amazed  by lists - regardless if I use them standalone as Microsoft Lists, in SharePoint or in Microsoft Teams. One thing, all my customers want to know, are calendar views. I run, together with Elio Struyf a sticker shop and we both not aim for delivering amazing stickers, but also continuesly improve our business. You could read in my last post, how I automated some social media activities, in this post I will show you how to create a content calendar and also automate creating actionable tasks from that as well. 

## Create a list with calendar view

I created a list in SharePoint and added columns for date, tweettext, hashtags URL and additional actions. Important: The Column, that contains the date needs to be a date column. I created some list items and created a new view: 

* Click **All Items**
* Click **Create New View**
* Give your view a nice name
* Click **Show as `Calendar`**
* Click **Create**

## automate creating tasks in Microsoft Planner

We use Microsoft Planner for our tasks, which is why I want the additional tasks, that come along with an event in this calendar to appear in our Planner board. Instead of copy-pasting everything manually, I built a flow that does exactly that for me automatically:
