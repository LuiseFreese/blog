# Why adoption projects fail

## key messages:

* organisations want to roll out Microsoft 365 to solve a broad variety of business problems like for instance information silos, unconnected workforce, waste of time etc., but problems persist if we only assign software licenses to users and don't take new working behavior into account
* the issue is not to learn how to use new tools to achieve a new behavior, but to know why we need to evolve ways of working (to solve different problems)
* usual approaches to achieve adoption are not sustainable, because users will quickly fall back in old behavior. 
* usual apprpoaches are also just scratching the surface, because they focus on quick wins instead of aiming to resolve organizational issues in a meaningful way
* same old thinking same old problems
