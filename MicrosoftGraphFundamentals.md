# Doing Microsoft Graph Fundamentals learning path on MS Learn

![Microsoft Graph Fundamentals LearningPath](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/GraphFun/GraphFun.png)

This blog post will summarize how I did the brand new [Microsoft Graph Fundamentals Learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/m365-msgraph-fundamentals/) . Microsoft Graph Fundamentals consists of 3 modules

1. What is Microsoft Graph - lets you understand the Graph services , and shows you how you can access user information from Graph using their learning playground called Graph Explorer. You will do a short exercise on that as well .

2. Configure a JavaScript application to retrieve Microsoft 365 data using Microsoft Graph - lets you understand how app registration works in Azure AD and permissions for Microsoft Graph powered apps and closes with 2 exercises using MSAL - making authentication easy. 
	
3. Access user photo information with Microsoft Graph - in this module you continue with the application you built in module 2 and learn how to retrieve a user photo and do an exercise about it. 

The whole learning path is estimated to be completed in ~75 minutes. Let's see how it goes :-) 

To be very honest: I worked with Graph before - see my blog posts about it here[ Microsoft Graph â€“ M365 Princess](https://m365princess.com/category/microsoft-graph/), but its the first time I do this guided learning on Microsoft Learn.
