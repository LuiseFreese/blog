# How to spend less time with organizing your agenda

Keeping our calendars as a representation our daily agenda is crucial, especially these days where we have more meetings than ever before.  In this blog post, I will give you some ideas how to let smart tools integrate with Outlook, so that you need to spend less time with scheduling meetings and have enough time as well to get the work in between of your meetings done. 

## Use Microsoft Bookings to schedule meetings with customers and community

It automatically sends invites, confirmations, and reminders and integrates perfectly with Microsoft Teams meetings. Bookings is available for all customers with 

* Microsoft 365 Business Premium
* Microsoft 365 Business Standard

* A5, 
* E3
* E5 

licenses and you will need Outlook on the web or Outlook mobile have enabled, which requires your mailbox to be in Exchange Online.

It reflects my availability and I can exclude times from it as well.  The beeauty of it is, that I do not need to send emails back and forth about scheduling a meeting anymore. This makes scheduling fast and effortless and looks very professional as well.
