# How to spend less time with organizing your agenda

Keeping our calendars as a representation our daily agenda is crucial, especially these days where we have more meetings than ever before.  In this blog post, I will give you some ideas how to let smart tools integrate with Outlook, so that you need to spend less time with scheduling meetings and have enough time as well to get the work in between of your meetings done. 

## Use Microsoft Bookings to schedule meetings with customers and community

Included in my Microsoft 365 license comes [Microsoft Bookings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/bookings/bookings-overview?view=o365-worldwide), a service that lets externals book appointments via website in free slots depending on your availability without letting them see your actual calendar. It automatically sends invites, confirmations, and reminders and integrates perfectly with Microsoft Teams meetings. Bookings is available for all customers with 

* Microsoft 365 Business Premium
* Microsoft 365 Business Standard
* A3
* A5
* E3
* E5 

licenses and you will need Outlook on the web or Outlook mobile have enabled, which requires your mailbox to be in Exchange Online. The bookings calendar will create a new calendar in Exchange Online as well as a related entry in Azure Active Directory. You can add scheduling policies and define timeincrements to be able to book, lead time upfront of a meeting and if you need to have time in between of meetings. 

I added a link to my bookings page to my Outlook signature and told my For me, this means that I just added a link to my bookings page into my Outlok signature and told my customers about it. Whenever a new customer-to-be or a someone from community wants to schedule a meeting, I reply with this link and bookings does the rest for me. It reflects my availability and I can exclude times from it as well.  The beeauty of it is, that I do not need to send emails back and forth about scheduling a meeting anymore. This makes scheduling fast and effortless and looks very professional as well. [Find more information here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/scheduling-and-booking-app).


## Use Cortana to schedule time for Weekly meetings, focus time, breaks and catching up with messages

## Use insights to increase awareness, protect your time and don't miss to stay on track

I use a service called [My Analatics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/mya-landing-page) that helps me to protect my precious time, makes me aware of unhealty working habit, supports me in staying in touch with people relevant to me and increase my reach. 

### How does My Analatycs work? 

My analytics a a personal productivity tracker. Think about is as your Smart Watch, that tell you to go for a walk, stand up regularly or that measures how fast you run (when you go for a run). 

My analytics works with 4 elements: 

* MyAnalytics dashboard - which is where you can see how you spent your time over the 4 weeks across 4 different plans: focus, wellbeing, collaboration and network 
* Insights Outlook add-in - gives you suggestions based on your working behavior
* Digests - This is a summary on the last week with actionable insights
* Inline suggestions in Outlook - recommendations to improve your work patterns

Ever wonderes how it can already be 5pm and how the heck you spent your day? Have been busy all day long but can't really tell how 9 hours could have passed but you still couldn't check off your most important tasks? Well, we all know those days and even weeks. The reasons are pretty obvious: 

* poor planning and proritizing of tasks / unclear committment which tasks need to be completed today
* too many meetings that don't add value to your work
* things get into the way of your planning and it's hard to stay on track
* it's challenging to change habits

To tackle these, I do the following: 

1. All my tasks will be reflected in Microsoft To Do: 

personal tasks
tasks that live in planner but can be accessed via To Do
emails from external people, that contain task, which can be accessed via To Do

Within To Do we can find a very interesting feature called "My Day" in which you daily commit to the tasks you want to work on today. Learn more about it in mb blog about [reasons why I fell in love with Microsoft to Do](https://m365princess.com/11-5-reasons-to-fall-in-love/). If you feel like having alreadu too much on the plate, it can be useful to dig a little bit deeper into [How to stop overcommitting](https://m365princess.com/how-to-avoid-overcommitting/)

2. I decide very carefully which meetings I attend. If I can't learn something in a meeting that I works towards the objectives of my team or me or if i can't contribute in a meaningful way, I will not participate. If you want to know more why and how I do this, read my blog post about [digital clutter and how we use our time](https://m365princess.com/digital-declutter-time/)

To protect my focus time, I use My Analytics:

The Focus Plan does not only give me an overview what happened in the past 4 weeks, but also encourages me to change, what didn't went as planned. It let's me schedule my focus time, (which will automatically set my status in Microsoft Teams to **DND**) and lets me review overlapping events in my calendar so that I am not double booked. 

![wellbeing plan](https://github.com/LuiseFreese/blog/blob/main/media/insights-wellbeingplan.png)

In the Wellbeing Plan gives me insights on my ability to disconnect and recharge my inner batteries. It calls me out on working crazy hours and suggests to take real breaks. Being confronted with real numbers instead of just guessing is very valuable to me, because I am very hesitant in taking time off. 


Ever wondered if the time you spend with meetings is really adding value? The collaboration plan confronts me with my meeting habits. If I joined on time, got distracted by writing emails during meetings, if I added a Teams link or if my meetings overlapped. This report is gold, because it reminds me, that I am responsible for getting the most out of the very precious time when I meet with others. If we try to multitask, need to join late and leave early, I will probably prioritzed other things. I find it very helpful to see this so I can readjust my commitments and make  more informed decisions what to work on.

Networking plan makes sure you don't stay in your filtierbubble only but expand your network.

I often say: "What isn't in my calendar, won't happen in my life!" I follow some very simple rules:
