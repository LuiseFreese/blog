# Modern SharePoint list formatting

This article shall give you guidance and inspiration how to turn your classic boring lists into interactive modern list experiences, which will wow your users, let them get information at first sight and increase overall productivity. This post is not about the Microsoft 365 list templates, I will cover them in the next blog post. 

If you never heard anything about modern SharePoint list formatting, don't worry, I will guide you through this. 

## why would I use SharePoint list

First things first: Why should you use SharePoint lists and not use - for instance - an Excel spreadsheet? Because we don't need to hide information in cascading folders, that should be at users fingertips. The beauty of lists lies in their simplicity and flexibility to organize work and track the information that matters most to your business. 

Creating, sharing and tracking lists is easy and available on any device, everyone stays in the loop and you can use lists for all kind of purposes like tracking issues, assets, routines, contacts, inventory, and more. Lists can easily be customized to make them visually more appealing and increase overall satisfaction. 

## How can I turn on modern experience

Now that I teased you into modern lists and libraries in SharePoint, it's time to turn on modern experiences. You can do it like this: 

in the classic experience
* select `Library Settings` or `List Settings` on the ribbon
* select `Advanced settings` and select `List experience`.
* select `New experience` 
* save with `ok`. 

### how can I change the look and feel of a list in the UI

Lists can contain different columns, and columns have a certain column type, depending on the kind of value you want to store in that column like text, number, date, choice, person, location, links or images. As lists can contain a lot of information, its very smart if we emphasize crucial parts by formatting them in a way that they are 

* more easy to read
* give a grasp on what is going on
* are mobile friendly

Already built-in we will find options to format columns and views. 
Formatting a view means modifying the way the entire list is displayed. Formatting a column means changing the way this column looks like.

#### Formatting columns

If we want to change the columns appearance, we can do that very enduser-friendly directly in the UI:

and even with rules like if - then - else:
