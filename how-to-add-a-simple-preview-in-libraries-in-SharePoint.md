# How to add a simple preview in a library in SharePoint

After my last #M365Hack where I showed you how you can create a [Dynamic preview for documents in SharePoint](https://m365princess.com/create-a-dynamic-preview-for-documents-in-sharepoint/) a few people reached out and asked about an easy way to just have a simple preview of a document or image in a library. 

Although this trick isn't knew at all, many of my customers found it valuable, which is why I want to share it here as well. 

## ‚ùì Question: Luise, can you build...

a preview for images and documents in a SharePoint library?

## ‚ùó Answer: Yes of course, we need...

an additional column (single line of text will do the job) and name this column **Thumbnail** - thats it. #Magic üîÆ

Works with .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx files.
