# Why I blog and how

I run this blog since a few years and sometimes people outside of my filter bubble ask me why I do this, as noone pays me for that and I don't have any ads on my website. Instead of explaining this over and over again, I decided to write a meta blog post on why I blog. If you come across my website for the very time today: I mostly blog about Microsoft 365 and Power Platform, sometimes I throw in some more personal posts as well. I write not only here, 

* but also on [Community Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/)
* took lead of the [Microsoft 365 PnP Community on TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-pnp-blog/bg-p/Microsoft365PnPBlog)
* run my own [food blog](https://thatkitchenprincess.com) and 
* write the stories for [PYOD news](https://pyod.shop), the blog of the sticker business that I run together with [Elio Struyf](https://eliostruyf.com)

You can say, that writing is an important part of my life. 

## Why do I blog?

### Sharing Is Caring

Seems we already covered the first reason for me to blog: If I know something that could potentially be valuable for others, it will be smart for me to write it down and make it accessible everyone. Some people then wonder, that if I share my professional knowledge for free, that this would weaken my position, that there will be less demand to hire me or others as consultants or developers. But I think that the opposite is true: By showing my knowledge and even sharing my learning journey in public, potential customers see what I am capable of and they don't need to guess if I have the right skillset nor if we have the right fit on a more personal level. Being open and sharing my knowledge has always been a big driver in my carreer, running this blog is part of it!

### Solidifying my knowledge

If we need to explain something you know to someone else, we will likely try to find examples, analogies and metaphors that our audience will find relatable, which will increase their understanding. Same happens when we blog about a solution or write a how-to guide or elaborate on thoughts regarding a product or a certain behaviour. We need to slow down our thinking and try to see our topic with different eyes. Changing the perspective will enable us to see the whole picture and will complement what we already know. It will allow us to flip sides and perceive our knowledge from a fresh view. And it will force us to get familiar not only with the 'hows', but also with the 'whys' of  best practices or different approaches as we will need to explain everything in detail. This applies even more, when we want to write bias- and assumtion-free, beginner-friendly content. 

> Blogging helps me solidifying my knowledge and broadening my view. 

### Exploring new areas

Sometimes, we do not only write about what we already know, but also about topics we want or need to explore. And then the fact, that we really need to understand the nitty gritty details lead to discovering more and more levels- and very often we will be surprised that the post actually took more time tob write, covers this topic in more depth and that we learned so much by writing it. Of course, if we happily jump into a new rabbit hole, we can't know how deep this is and how much time and effort it will take us to understand it. Perhaps we will notice half-way, that our previous assumptions, where this post will lead to, were partially or completely wrong, or we will learn, how our freshly gained knowledge connects to and relates with the things we already know. This is very rewarding for me, personally: not only learning fact, but actually being able to connect the dots and make sense of subjects, that I didn't (fully) understand before. As the world (and tech) gets more complex, it's so important to understand impacts of for example new features, changes in licensing, product launches etc. 

> Writing blog posts makes me easier and more sustainable understand new things and connecting them with my existing knowledge

### Extending comfort zone

But there is another aspect of writing what we know or what we want to explore. It is about being open our learning journing and finding joy in being a #LearnItAll. I don't think, that stepping outside of our comfort zones (and then returning to it) is something we should look for. I rather aim to *extend* my comfort zone so that once I managed to do the thing outside of my comfort zone, my comfort zone (and me within) grow. 

> Being a content creator allows me to grow both personally and professionally while sharing my passion with community

### Reuseability /Repurposeability

Once I wrote a blog post, I can repurpose the gained/solidified knowledge eaily: I can give sessions, workshops, talks about it, participate with my perspective in panel discussions or TweetJams or interviews and do not need to limit myself to the fact that this is a one-time-publishing event. Reusing my content makes me aware about how much I already know and what is still not adressed to everyone. As we know, that new people start every day, and we overestimate a lot what people know. Therefore it's a good idea to reuse what we already published, because it will not only expose us to new audiences, but also help them to find their way into this community and to pay it forward as well. 

### (so called) Soft Skills

Sometimes, I hear people telling "Oh I couldn't write that often/about so much" or "I wouldn't know where to start" or even "wait, you write **after** you already finished a long workday?". Writing taught me some skills, that I need in my day-to-day life: 

#### Persistence

For this year, I want to write 50 blog posts, which means ~1 blog post per week. This doesn't sound that much, but actually I need to find inspiration for a topic I want to blog about, and it does not only take the time to write down your thought, but to think, explore, try something out talk with others, learn, exchange views, learn even more, etc. Being persistent and making writing one of my habits that I *nearly* do every single day helps me with that: I get more easily in the mood of writing, which means that my mind talks more easily to my typing fingers while my eyes are reading what I am writing. When I am really *in the zone* I perceive this feeling of being in the flow: I forget time, I am highly focused on the topic but the same time extremely relaxed. This feelings makes me feel good and I get somehow a little bit addicted to it. Sometimes during the dayk, when I am stressed because of too many meetings or a lot of task-switching I am already looking forward to my writing session in the evenings. 

#### Critical Thinking

As I write so often, I do not only think about writing when I write, but I see everything also with the lens of: "Could thois be something that I should elaborate on in a blog post?". And by seeing, I mean all phases of critical thinking like

* Remembering
* Understanding
* Applying
* Analyzing
* Evaluating
* Creating

It is not enough to remember knowledge or to understand it or to use and implement it, but I also aim to organize, structure and check what I learned. And then, of course, I love to create by designing and building solutions. 

> Blogging give me more opportunities to do new things

* Empathy

Changing perspectives and figuring out how others feel about something doesn not only broaden my horizon, but also affects my process of decision-making and makes me communicate better. As a result, empathy makes my content more accessible, more inclusive and more bias free. 

> Creating Content makes me even more empathetic and lets me even more understand the true value of a holistic diversity of backgrounds and skills  

* Creativity

This one souds too obvious, right? When I *create* a new blog post, this is about creativity. It is about the act of making *something* out of *nothing*. I do not only modify something, but produce something unique, that represents my knowledge, my beliefs and serves my purpose. Some people fight against the fear of the blinking cursor. But I managed to turn this uncertainty, and my sometimes occurring doubts if my thoughts are worth a read into the freedom to express myself how I want it. I enjoy being a content creator and to do this on my terms on conditions. I don't have any deadlines (although I set a goal on frequency), no topics to cover, no specific amount of lines to write. My blogs are an invitation for others to learn and feel inspired to share what they know as well. 

> My blogging habits make me feel more confident about my skills

## How to I blog

After the big *why* of blogging and why this represents so much of *Sharing is Caring* for me, here is my 

### setting

I write my blogposts as markdown-files in a public repository in GitHub. 

#### markdown

This allows me to focus on my content instead of being distracted by a UI that gives me too many options to format my text. Concentrating onm writing lets me more easily get into this flow-feeling, where  words and thoughts seem to directly from from my mind into my fingers. 

#### public

*Butwhy on earth do you write in public?* people ask me. *You could setup a private repo, once you commit the whole world can see your ~~shitty~~ non mature first drafts, your rough ideas, your typos and broken links*. Yes, that is true. But alsothere is nothing wrong about not being perfect or about showing work in progress. I feel very comfortable with that. Plus, if someone finds a typo, everyone is totally invited to PR that :-)
